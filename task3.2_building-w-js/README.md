# Intro to react
- It’s declarative: Code written in React is easy to read and, therefore, easy to maintain.
- It’s component-based: To build with React, you create reusable components. This allows you to increase the scope of your web app with little to no performance issues (it’s super fast!) or concerns about entropy.
- It works well with data: The data you display to your users can change over time without having to reload the page.
- It’s compatible with other tools: For example, React Native, a framework for building native apps using React, and Redux, a library for managing app states. You’ll learn more about these tools later on in this course.
- It has a wide user base and plenty of online resources.
- It's built, used, and supported by Facebook: React’s documentation is well maintained, and you won’t have to wait several weeks for bug fixes!
- It’s relatively small.
